## 🌟 Why You’ll Love This Project
Ever wondered how queues work in real life? Here’s a Minecraft build that turns abstract CS concepts into a functional, block-powered logistics system! Watch as items zoom through rails, obeying the strict FIFO rule, all while you learn core DSA principles. Perfect for gamers, educators, and coders!

## 🚨 Key Features

🚂 FIFO on Rails
Items are processed first-come, first-served—no cutting the line!

🤖 Fully Automated
Hoppers, minecarts, and Redstone circuitry work together like clockwork.

📈 Scalable Design
Expand it for massive farms, mining ops, or your mega-builds!

🎓 Learn While You Play
See queues in action—no textbooks needed.

## 🧱 System Components

Component	Role	Emoji

Source Chest	Enqueue items into the queue	📦
Redstone Logic	Control timing and dequeue operations	🔌
Minecart Network	Transport items FIFO-style	🚋
Destination Chest	Store processed items at the "rear"	🏁

## 🎮 How It Works (In Minecraft Terms)

Enqueue
Drop items into the Source Chest → Hoppers feed them into a waiting minecart.

Queue Management
Redstone circuits ensure minecarts depart only when the next track is free.

Dequeue
Items arrive at the Destination Chest in the exact order they were sent.

System Flow Spoiler: It’s satisfying to watch!

## ⚙️ Technical Specs
Built in Minecraft Java Edition 1.20+

Uses Redstone comparators, repeaters, and observers for logic.

Inspired by Introduction to Algorithms (but way more fun).
