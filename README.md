Real-world Application of Queue Data Structure using Minecraft ‚Äî Rail Track Delivery System

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue data structure within Minecraft, creating an automated Rail Track Delivery System for efficient item transportation. Leveraging Minecraft mechanics like hoppers, minecarts, and Redstone logic, the system ensures items are collected, processed, and delivered in strict order, mirroring real-world queue operations.

Key Features:

FIFO Principle: Ensures items are transported in the order they are received.

Automated Workflow: Uses hoppers, minecarts, and Redstone circuitry for seamless item collection, transfer, and delivery.

Scalable Design: Ideal for large-scale Minecraft farms, mining operations, or resource management.

Educational Focus: Bridges gaming and computer science, illustrating core DSA concepts (queues) in a virtual environment.

Components:

Source Chest (Enqueue): Entry point for items into the queue.

Redstone Logic: Controls timing and operations (dequeue).

Minecart Rail Network: Transports items between locations.

Destination Chest (Rear): Final storage after processing.

Technical Details:

Built in Minecraft Java Edition using Redstone mechanics.

Emphasizes DSA concepts like queue operations (enqueue/dequeue).

Includes performance analysis and challenges encountered during development.

Repository Contents:

Full project report (PDF) with architecture, flowchart, and implementation details.

Screenshots of the system in action (start/deposit areas, Redstone logic).

References to Minecraft Redstone guides and DSA textbooks.
